# js-jQuery-Simon-Game-Exercise
Exercise from The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp
<hr>
I took on the Simon game challenge, starting from the introductory video and coding without any hints. After getting the game functional, I added some extra features to practice more JS and jQuery. These included a start screen with rules, game difficulty levels, spacebar input instead of any key, a timer, pause functionality, hints, a remaining buttons counter, and a next level button between levels.

Ps. This was a JavaScript exercise, so I focused on the JavaScript code rather than the site's responsiveness. As such, the site is not responsive and may not display well on all devices.
